[Google Doc Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SU8x_TNHdjzocSAzvC8QoXhl9OhHDEsWQrIHwncAQSI/edit?usp=sharing) 

## Schedule:
- Team Formation (please find your team by April 30)
    - each team can have two or three members.
    - But for teams of three, you need to complete the compulsory topic and two selective topics.) 
    - Submitting your code and video record (by May 12)
    
## Notes:
- You are welcome to meet with instructors and LAs for the project. Feel free to book a meeting.
- Q&A: (A few questions and solutions found in the previous semesters) [Docs Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VGs13szC3GiDqtlSiaJRoMwcjUz3fRV18LoXR2kd5sE/edit?usp=sharing)

## Graphic User Interface (GUI) 
-------------------------------

### Current State
Currently, the chat system is run from the terminal command line. All input and output are only found from the plain terminal window. You might want to add a user interface to enhance the chatting experience. 

### The Goal
To construct an interface using Python packages like Tkinter, so that there is no need to type or read from the terminal window when a client connects to the chat server. All information being exchanged will be displayed on the GUI.

### The Bottom Line 
is that you need to make a GUI that can take and display messages for the user. Other interesting features to try out are logging in with passwords, file transferring, voice/video chatting, etc. 

### Extras
Besides, you should try to integrate your work on the selective topic with the GUI. For example, if your selective topic is Secure Messaging, you can use the encryption algorithms to transmit the messages behind the GUI. Or, if your selective topic is Online Gaming, you may add a button in the GUI that can start the game you designed.

## Secure Messaging 
-------------------
### Introduction
Turing and his friends built one of the first computers to crack the Enigma code. Every technology, by itself, stands as a double-edged sword. As a user, you have the right to protect your transactions against eavesdropping. 
But the question is: how? 

### Assignment
The intuitive idea is, of course, `to scramble your message`, a process that we call encryption. `You want your friend to read the clear message, so you will need decryption as well.` This takes the form of an agreement between you and your friend before you send your scrambled message. 

### Information
On the Internet, everything said is in the open. So there is no hideaway in which you and your friend can meet. So how is it possible to establish such an agreement, and then communicate? 

The field of computer security (and a related field, data privacy) is a vast and interesting research area. In this project, however, we only want to get a taste of it. 

### The goal: 
* Get two chat clients to communicate with each other securely, meaning that the server who is passing the messages in between has no idea what they are talking about. 
* You will need to implement a shared key protocol as well as a simple encryption/decryption algorithm for the client-side, and make this work!
* Reference: MacCormick, 9 algorithms, Chapter 4.

## Grading Policy
-----------------

The work will be evaluated on the following criteria:
‚óè	Compulsory topic: 50% 
‚óã	Baseline (40%): the GUI can take and display messages for users
‚óã	Innovative features (10%): the GUI contains one (or more) ingenious functions, e.g., login password, emoji, etc.
‚óè	Selective topic: 20%
‚óã	Completeness (10%): the code works properly, and the goals of the topic are achieved.
‚óã	Integrated into the GUI (10%): the functions work with the GUI
‚óè	Video Presentation: 30%
üòä
‚óã	Introduction(6%): Tell the audience what your project is; what is your motivation?
‚óã	Demo of the app(6%): A demo of your work, showing what your app looks like and how it works
‚óã	Discussion (6%): Tell the audience what you did in the development, e.g., what packages you use, and/or, the significant modification in the original chat system
‚óã	Analysis(6%): Your reflections on the development, e.g., is the organization of your code reasonable? What classes do you define? Or, the possible improvements
‚óã	Impression(6%): This is about the impression of your presentation and your workload, being ranked with regard to others
